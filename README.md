#Java Solitaire Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Solitaire card game in Java. It includes several components to manage cards, the game logic, and a graphical display.

Components:

Card

The Card class represents a standard playing card with a rank, suit, and can be faceup or facedown. This class is a fundamental building block for the Solitaire game. Cards can be manipulated, compared, and used to create the game's tableau.

Solitaire

The Solitaire class is the core logic of the Solitaire game. It creates a deck of cards, organizes them by suit in order, and allows for stacking cards on each other with alternating colors in descending order. This class encapsulates the rules and movements of the game.

SolitaireDisplay

The SolitaireDisplay class provides a graphical representation of the Solitaire game. It allows players to interact with the game visually and see the state of the tableau, foundation, and other game elements. This class enhances the user experience by providing a graphical interface for playing Solitaire.
